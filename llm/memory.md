---

## Project Overview

### Vision
MortarGolf is a unique blend of golf and combat - players use mortars to shoot through 9 holes while driving golf carts and fending off opponents. Think "Happy Gilmore meets Battlefield" with AI caddies, between-hole shopping, and speed-based scoring.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Mortar-based Golf** - 3-click shot meter system for precise control
2. **Combat During Play** - Opponents can disrupt your shots
3. **Speed Matters** - Faster completion earns more money
4. **Shop System** - Buy upgrades between holes
5. **Caddy System** - AI or player caddies provide support
6. **Career Tracking** - Passcode system for persistent stats

### Technical Approach
- Multi-file TypeScript development using custom build system
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive helper library for common operations
- Following patterns from official BF6 Portal mods

---

## Important Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

#### Build System Choice
**Decision**: Use multi-file development with custom build system  
**Reason**: Better code organization, easier maintenance, cleaner git diffs  
**Trade-off**: Requires build step, but worth it for clarity  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### File Organization
**Decision**: Organize by functionality (types, state, helpers, ui, etc.)  
**Structure**:
```
src/
├── types.ts       # Type definitions
├── constants.ts   # Configuration
├── state.ts       # Global state
├── helpers.ts     # Utilities
├── ui.ts          # UI components
├── player.ts      # Player management
├── messages.ts    # Messages
├── gameflow.ts    # Game logic
├── updates.ts     # Update loops
└── events.ts      # Event handlers
```
**Reason**: Matches official mod patterns, scales well  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

### Gameplay Decisions

#### Shot Mechanic: Mortar vs Other Options
**Decision**: Use mortars as the "golf ball"  
**Alternatives Considered**: Grenades, actual golf balls, tank shells  
**Reason**: Mortars provide the arc trajectory needed for golf-like gameplay  
**Trade-offs**: May need custom physics tuning for realistic distances  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Putting System: Dart-Based
**Decision**: Use dart + randomized target system for putting  
**Alternatives Considered**: Traditional meter, skill-based aim  
**Reason**: Adds variety, prevents putting from being too easy/formulaic  
**How**: Target spawns at distance based on previous putt accuracy  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Combat Integration
**Decision**: Allow combat during opponent shots, caddy provides defense  
**Reason**: Adds tension and strategy without making combat the primary focus  
**Balance**: Caddies can revive, death = +1 stroke penalty  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Score Persistence: Passcode System
**Decision**: Generate passcodes for external website tracking  
**Reason**: SDK doesn't support networking, this is a creative workaround  
**Future**: Could use QR codes for easier mobile entry  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Development Tooling: Automated Version Bumping
**Decision**: Created Python script for automated version management  
**Reason**: Manual version updates across 5+ files is error-prone and tedious  
**Benefits**: Single command updates all version references consistently  
**Implementation**: `tools/bump_version.py` with semver support (major/minor/patch)  
**Files Updated**: package.json, constants.ts, README.md, todo.md, CHANGELOG.md  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Git Repository Root
**Decision**: MortarGolf folder is the git repository root  
**Reason**: Allows independent version control for the mod  
**Impact**: All git commands must be run from MortarGolf directory  
**Documentation**: Added to dev_guidelines.md with examples  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Localization Strings File
**Decision**: All user-facing text must be in `MortarGolf.strings.json` - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**  
**Reason**: Follow SDK best practices for localization support  
**Rule**: **NEVER** hardcode display strings in TypeScript - always use the strings file with `mod.Message()`  
**Format**: JSON file with string keys and placeholder support (e.g., `{}` for dynamic values)  
**Location**: Root of mod folder alongside compiled TypeScript  
**Examples**: See BombSquad.strings.json, Vertigo.strings.json for reference patterns  
**Documentation**: Added comprehensive section to dev_guidelines.md with prominent reminder  
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### State Machine Architecture
**Decision**: Implement formal state machine with validation rather than simple state variables  
**Reason**: Complex game flow with many states and transitions needs proper management  
**Architecture**:
- Map-based valid transition validation (prevents invalid state changes)
- State entry/exit callbacks for custom behavior
- Centralized state transition functions
- Integrated timer system per state
- Pause/resume capability built-in
**Benefits**:
- Prevents bugs from invalid state transitions
- Easy to debug current state and transitions
- Clean separation of concerns per state
- Scalable for additional states if needed
**Trade-offs**: Slightly more complex than simple flags, but much more maintainable
**Pattern**: Follows standard state machine patterns from game development
**Date**: October 17, 2025

#### Update Loop Architecture
**Decision**: Split update logic by game state using switch-case rather than scattered if statements  
**Reason**: Better organization, clearer code, easier to maintain and extend  
**Implementation**:
- Two main loops: Fast (60fps via mod.Wait(tickRate)) and Slow (1s)
- Switch-case on current game state in each loop
- Separate functions per state (updateLobbyTick, updatePlayingThrottled, etc.)
- Pause detection built into main loops
**Benefits**:
- Clear what code runs in which state
- Easy to add new states
- Performance: only relevant code runs per state
- Debugging: can trace execution by state
**Alternative Considered**: Single monolithic update with many if statements - rejected as unmaintainable
**Date**: October 17, 2025

## Technical Notes

### Development Tools

#### Version Bump Script
Location: `tools/bump_version.py`

Automates version updates across project:
- Updates package.json version field
- Updates constants.ts VERSION constant array
- Updates README.md badges and footer
- Updates todo.md version and date
- Creates CHANGELOG.md template for new version

Usage:
```bash
python tools/bump_version.py patch  # 0.0.3 -> 0.0.4
python tools/bump_version.py minor  # 0.0.3 -> 0.1.0
python tools/bump_version.py major  # 0.0.3 -> 1.0.0
```

Can be run with SDK's bundled Python:
```bash
../../python/python.exe tools/bump_version.py patch
```

### SDK Limitations Discovered
1. **No Networking**: Can't persist data across matches directly
   - **Workaround**: Passcode system for external website
2. **Single File Requirement**: Portal requires one .ts file
   - **Workaround**: Build system combines multiple files
3. **Limited Animations**: Can't create custom player animations
   - **Workaround**: Use existing soldier animations creatively

### Helper Functions Added
Added 50+ helper functions to `src/helpers.ts`:
- **Team Management**: GetPlayersOnTeam, CountAlivePlayersOnTeam, AreTeammates
- **Scoring**: FormatScore, GetScoreName, SortPlayersByScore
- **Math**: Clamp, Lerp, GetAngleBetween, NormalizeAngle
- **Colors**: Predefined color constants, hex to RGB conversion
- **Arrays**: Shuffle, WeightedRandom, UniqueArray
- **Timers**: CountdownTimer, WaitForCondition, DelayedExecute
- **Formatting**: FormatTime, FormatNumber, RoundTo

### Code Patterns to Follow
Based on official mods (Vertigo, BombSquad, etc.):
1. Always use `mod.GetObjId()` for team comparisons
2. Check `IsPlayerValid()` before accessing players
3. Clean up UI elements in `OnPlayerLeaveGame`
4. Use separate fast (NextTick) and slow (Wait) update loops
5. Cache frequently used objects

---

## Blockers & Questions

### Current Blockers
None at this time.

### Open Questions
1. **Q**: How to best implement the AI caddy pathfinding?
   - **Status**: Need to research BF6 AI capabilities
   - **Priority**: Medium (v0.5 feature)

2. **Q**: What's the best way to detect "on green" vs "on fairway"?
   - **Options**: Area triggers, position checking, collision detection
   - **Status**: Leaning toward area triggers for simplicity
   - **Priority**: High (v0.1 feature)

3. **Q**: How to implement wind effects on mortar trajectory?
   - **Status**: May need to study projectile physics in SDK
   - **Priority**: Medium (v0.5 feature)

---

## Lessons Learned

### From Setup Phase
1. **Documentation First Pays Off**: Creating comprehensive docs before coding helps clarify the vision
2. **Build System is Essential**: Multi-file development is much cleaner than single file
3. **Helper Functions Save Time**: Creating a utility library up front prevents code duplication
4. **Todo Granularity**: Breaking tasks into small pieces makes progress trackable

### Best Practices Established
1. Always read the brief before starting a new phase
2. Follow the dev guidelines for consistent code style
3. Update memory.md with any important decisions
4. Keep CHANGELOG.md current
5. Test with multiple player counts early and often
6. **🔴 CRITICAL: All user-facing text goes in MortarGolf.strings.json** - Never hardcode strings in TypeScript, always use `mod.Message()`
7. Use the version bump script for all version updates
8. Reference existing 1st party mod strings files (BombSquad, Vertigo) for format examples
